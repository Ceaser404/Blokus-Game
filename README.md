<h1>Blokus Game with html, css, and JS</h1>

<h3>This is a html/css/Javascript version of the board game Blokus. The interface layout was made with css-grid. The project used Javascripts Document Object Model throughout for keydown and click inputs. 
User interactivity included selecting pieces, moving pieces, rotating pieces, placing pieces, and disabling players. A CSS Webkit scrollbar was originaly added for piece selection, 
but that was removed as the arrow keys would move the scrollbar when the user was moving pieces.</h3>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<h3>1. Select where to place piece by clicking a grid on the html canvas (game board) with mouse</h3>
<h3>2. Pick your piece by clicking on "Choose Piece" button</h3>
<h3>3. Move piece accordingly with arrow keys and rotate piece with spacebar</h3>
<h3>4. Place piece with Shift key</h3>
<h3>5. Repeat for next player</h3>

<h3>Blue wins with the lowest remaining tiles!</h3>

<h4>The game is missing useful features such as an undo button, flipping pieces, and the pieces images do not yet switch properly based on remaining players to name a few issues.
  However, this game was useful in learning to use Javascript DOM tools such as .getElementById(), .innerHTML, .querySelector(), and .addEventListener(). </h4>
